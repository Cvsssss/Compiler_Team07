Our teamwork is at the Compiler/unam.fi.compilers.g5.07, you need to run it with a virtual enviroment,
you can create one with python3 -m venv venv
and you need 4 libraries, (this was tested on MacOS using Microsoft Visual Studio)

* ttkbootstrap (pip install ttkbootstrap)
* ⁠Pillow (pip install Pillow)
* ⁠ply (pip install ply)
* ⁠graphviz (pip install graphviz)
after this you need to follow the instructions set on the document, the main file is the one called GUI.py
